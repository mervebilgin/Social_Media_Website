# Social_Media_Website
In this project, a Social Media Application was developed from scratch. I developed it as an K146-React-Bootcamp-graduation project. The project includes the user registration page and login page. After the user logs in, there are features such as the user's follower information, user profile information, the user's ability to share and delete the post, and the user's ability to like the posts on the home page. 

It is thought that the chat section will be added to this social media application later.

Technologies used throughout the project process;
  * Node.js
  * React.js
  * Express.js
  * MongoDB Atlas
  * Postman
  
#### In my project, I used react on the frontend, node.js and express.js on the backend, MongoDB for database operations and Postman for test operations.

 ## React.js
 React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. 
 React was used in the frontend of the project.

 ## Node.js
 
 Node.js is an open-source server environment. Node.js is cross-platform and runs on Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS, etc. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

 ## Express.js
 Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
 
 Express is the back-end component of popular development stacks like the MEAN, MERN or MEVN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and a JavaScript front-end framework or library.
